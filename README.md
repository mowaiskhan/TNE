You may pick any of the modern day's shared-economy business solutions ranging from ride-hailing apps, to accommodation sharing while travelling, there is one serious issue that has been spooking the users - 'Trust deficit' (User not knowing the Provider and vice-versa)! There have been various methods where companies tried to build processes to ensure "Trust" and they surely have done wonders in conventional business models. 

But as shared economies are increasing in volumes and penetration, the width and depth of problems related to 'Trust' is growing at an unprecedented pace. 

Taking a step back from technology and thinking how humans behave in real world would enable us to think through how this problem can be addressed. Simply speaking, in our non-digital lives, we trust people who we know or who our acquaintances know. 

We have tried to formulate this "human chain" into a system which can be used to build trust for shared-economy systems. 

This paper and reference implementation highlights how one such system can be built and scaled.
